This explains what each of the hyperparameters does as i understand it:

alpha and beta:
    they control the weights in the smoothmess term in the optimization equation
    more means stronger implementation of TC
    They control how much importance is given to smoothness constraints versus fidelity to the processed frames
    too much may induce too much smoothmess and thus artifacts

gamma:
    Balances the importance of global vs local consistency in the optimization
    increasing would increase the global consistency reducing the long term inconsistency
    too much might lead to over smoothning
    decreasing it means a boost to the local consistency meaning higher frame by frame fidelity
    decreasing too much would lead to noisy video

pyramid_levels:
    the levels in optical flow computation
    more means more time but more accurate flow
    less means faster but less accurate flow

iteration:
    the steps the optimization solver runs for
    more means slower but more consistent frames
    less means fast and obviously less consistent

step_size:
    the learning rate fot the optimization solver

mom_fac:
    the momentum_factor controls how much of the previous optimization step influences the current step
    a higher value would speed up the convergence by carrying over past gradients
    and decreasing may be more stable but slower
